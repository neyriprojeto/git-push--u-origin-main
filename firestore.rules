/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a role-based and ownership-based security model
 * for a church management application. The primary goal is to ensure that sensitive member
 * data is protected, collaborative groups are managed securely by their designated admins,
 * and public-facing church information is readable by anyone.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /members/{memberId}: Contains sensitive, private information about each church member.
 * - /groups/{groupId}: Represents collaborative groups, with access controlled by a members map.
 * - /churchInfo/{churchInfoId}: A singleton collection for publicly readable church information.
 * - /congregacoes/{congregacaoId}: A public list of church congregations.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Default Secure Posture: Access to the /members collection is completely locked down by
 *   default. This is a critical security measure because the provided data model does not
 *   specify an administrative role or a clear link between a 'Member' document and an
 *   authenticated Firebase user. These rules must be updated once an admin system is designed.
 * - Group Management: Access to /groups is controlled by a denormalized `members` map on
 *   each group document. A user must have the 'admin' role within that map to modify or
 *   delete the group. This avoids slow and costly lookups in other collections.
 * - Public Information: /churchInfo and /congregacoes are publicly readable to allow anonymous
 *   users to view general church details and for new users to register. Writes are disabled
 *   pending the definition of an admin role.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: To ensure performant and secure access control, this
 * ruleset relies on denormalized data. Specifically, the `/groups/{groupId}` documents are
 * expected to contain a `members` map (e.g., `{ members: { 'user_uid_1': 'admin', 'user_uid_2': 'member' } }`)
 * which is used directly in the rules to grant role-based permissions without needing to
 * query other collections.
